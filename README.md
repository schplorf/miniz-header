=========

A cross-platform header-only library for reading and writing ZIP files using a nice simple API similar to [Python's zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html). See [examples/ (On parent repo)](https://github.com/tfussell/miniz-cpp/tree/master/examples) for a demonstration of the use of the library.
